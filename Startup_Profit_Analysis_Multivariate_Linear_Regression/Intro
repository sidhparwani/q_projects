For this project, we will be analyzing the profits generated by 50 startups. 
The data we are provided includes the startup's location, research and development costs, administrative costs, marketing costs, and profit generated. 
Furthermore, we will be building a regression model to see which variables play a significant role in the amount of profit generated. 
We will use backward elimination to build an efficient model.

This dataset was provided by Kirill Eremenko.
